# In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.

# It is written using the Greek letter phi as φ(n) or ϕ(n), and may also be called Euler's phi function.

In other words, it is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) is equal to 1.[2][3] The integers k of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of n.
